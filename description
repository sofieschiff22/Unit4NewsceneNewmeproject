2025 recap:
In the photos I put places that I traveled to such as hawaii, and las vegas. I also added a picture of my sister and I headed to a football game.
2026 goals: I put a picture that says summer which for me meant that I was excited for summer and can't wait to hangout with my friends. I also put an A+ paper which meant better study habits and betterr grades. I put a picture of a volleyball hoping to imporve more this year, and lastly a picture of the gym to get more fit and healthier for volleyball.
